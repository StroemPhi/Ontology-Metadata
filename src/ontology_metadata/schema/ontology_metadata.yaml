      The PURL of an ontology is its persistent identifier. It is usually used by within the ontology to state:
      `<https://www.domain.de/myOntology> rdf:type owl:Ontology.` 
      It is usually able to locate and retrieve the ontology on the world wide web, so pasting it into your web browser should retrieve a digital document. Furthermore, it is often configured to do content negotiation so that different related resources can be retrieved with the same identifier - e.g. the human-readable ontology documentation or different serializations of an ontology.        
      Ontologies usually also use the PURL to identify their classes and properties, e.g. in statements like:          
          `<https://www.domain.de/myOntology#someProperty> rdf:type owl:AnnotationProperty.`
      A working PURL is required to retrieve the ontology for indexing by the TIB Terminology Service.

      - The ontology should declare its own preferred prefix. The prefix should be unique. You can check whether an ontology prefix is already in use on services like [prefix.cc](https://prefix.cc) or [bioregistry.io](https://bioregistry.io).

      A version URI is a persistent identifier for a version of an ontology and is used just like its PURL to reliably retrieve a former version of an ontology. Since a PURL usually only points to the latest version of an ontology, each ontology version should additionally state its version URI.
      The textual version information is usually part of a version URI of an ontology.
      Here is an example from the Academic Event Ontology:
      ```http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/aeon/aeon-full.owl
      http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/aeon/releases/2022-11-25/aeon-full.owl```
      
      Here is an example from ListDB Ontology:
      ```https://w3id.org/listdb/onto/
      https://w3id.org/listdb/onto/0.0.1```
      
      Here is an example from the GND Ontology:

      The ontology should describe its own contents and scope with a few words or sentences in order to inform human users what the ontology tries to accomplish.
      The description is displayed in the TIB Terminology Service ontology list and on the start page of each ontology - we therefore recommend to keep it short! For an extensive discussion about the ontology you may want to consider the publication of a traditional academic article or a detailed documentation.

      To familiarize interested others with the concepts and scope of your ontology, you should consider creating some kind of documentation. A relatively easy way to do this, is to use the tool [Widoco](https://pad.gwdg.de/). It generates the documentation from the ontology and a resulting html-document can be published, for example with GitLab Pages. This auto-generated document can contain customary additions that help users to understand the ontology better.

    description: A prefix of an ontology or vocabulary namespace according to the [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xml-names-19990114/#NT-NCName) that is not the officially preferren one but an alternative that may be used in different contexts (e.g. **DCTERMS** or **dct** instead of the [preferredPrefix](preferredPrefix) **dcterms** for [http://purl.org/dc/terms/](http://purl.org/dc/terms/).
    comments:
      - This property is recommended to be used when there are multiple prefixes in use for a namespace, to allow resolvability of CURIEs.
