`<https://www.domain.de/myOntology> rdf:type owl:Ontology.` 
It is usually able to locate and retrieve the ontology on the world wide web, so pasting it into your web browser should retrieve a digital document. Furthermore, it is often configured to do content negotiation so that different related resources can be retrieved with the same identifier - e.g. the human-readable ontology documentation or different serializations of an ontology.        
Ontologies usually also use the PURL to identify their classes and properties, e.g. in statements like:          
    `<https://www.domain.de/myOntology#someProperty> rdf:type owl:AnnotationProperty.`
A working PURL is required to retrieve the ontology for indexing by the TIB Terminology Service.
